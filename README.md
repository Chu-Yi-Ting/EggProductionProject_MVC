# Egg Production Management Platform

## Introduction
This project was developed in response to the 2022 egg shortage in Taiwan. The current egg production statistics often rely on periodic declarations or agricultural censuses, resulting in low data update frequency. Factors such as diseases and natural disasters can cause rapid changes in egg production, making it difficult for the industry to obtain accurate information in real-time and adjust supply accordingly.

Additionally, small-scale chicken farmers often face challenges in finding sales channels, making it difficult to promote high-quality eggs to a broader consumer market. Our goal is to build a platform that not only records and analyzes farming data in real-time but also provides sales channels for small-scale chicken farmers.

Through a diverse user base, we aim to serve not only chicken farmers but also consumers and agricultural professionals interested in the egg industry. The platform includes features such as videos and discussion forums, allowing users to share farming experiences, discuss market trends, and promote the growth and development of the local industry.
